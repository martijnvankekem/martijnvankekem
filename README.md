### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Martijn van Kekem, and I'm a full-stack developer, proudly working on projects such as MatchGear.

Besides being a Computer Science student at Eindhoven University of Technology, I started my own software developing a few years back, Martijn van Kekem Development. The biggest project I'm actively invested in is MatchGear, a smartwatch application for umpires from various sports with an Apple, Android or Tizen smartwatch.
