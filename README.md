### Hi there 👋

My name's Martijn van Kekem, and I'm a developer who's passionate about everything with a power cord, umpiring hockey (the non-icy one), and being a general nerd.

Projects I'm actively working on:

- 🏑 [Hockey Match Calendar](https://github.com/Martijn-van-Kekem-Development/hockey-match-calendar): automatically fetches hockey matches and converts them into ICS files.
